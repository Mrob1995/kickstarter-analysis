# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the optimal parameters for a crowdfunding campaign.


## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The two main deliverables for this module were centered around pivot tables, charts, and simple conditionals. I am brand new to Excel so my primary challenge has just been getting comfortable on the program. Simple things like pressing enter instead of trying to click out of a cell. While I may not be familiar with Excel functions whatsoever, I have found there to be an incredible amount of information around, as well as pretty clear documentation directly from Microsoft. I found the nesting nature of =Ifs and =CountIfs to be especially intuitive. I'll also give a special thanks and formal citation to >https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14494747/how-to-add-images-to-readme-md-on-github as I was having a lot of trouble getting a png to display correctly when trying to give an address to an existing file on my computer.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - There is a very clear spike in successful campaign outcomes in May, that slowly tapers off throughout the summer. Without a doubt, that would be the best period to debut a campaign. The very worst time to start a campaign would fall in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - Grouping outcomes by the size of the campaign's initial goal yields very useful information. As is to be expected, there is an initial dropoff in success as the goal climbs from below one thousand up into five figures, but what is more relevant is the stark drop that happens above $44,999. This would be the ideal ceiling for a theater campaign goal. Going above $45,000 sees an immediate drop in successes from 49%, all the way down to 29%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - The pool of information for higher value goals falls off rather starkly. The sample size for campaigns with a goal above $40,000 represents only 10.6% of the total campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - I also think this analysis fails to include the final amount raised. I should expect anyone hiring professional analysis for kickstarter goals would be interested in knowing what goal level produces the highest average final contribution amount.
